2, Precipitation is like god crying all over us. When the tears get to the ground they evaporate back up. Condensation is gods tears during evaporation when the get trapped in earths atmosphere. the collection happens the water goes into the lakes. 
1,Evaporation changes a liquid into a gas which would be the clouds. when the happy little cloud's party is over it drank so much the liquor turned to condensation. the condensation turns to precipitation so the little cloud's liquor falls to earth. collection of the clouds liquor pee in the ocean gets all the fish drunk.
5,"Evaporation is when a liquid turns into gas because heat energy is changing its state of matter. When evaporation is in effect outside it may get humid and very hot. The reason any water may evaporate is because of precipitation. Rain, snow, and sleet may fall and that is precipitation, condensed water that falls due to gravity. Then when you put a bucket outside and collect water you can put it into a collection pile. Ahhh condensation!!!"
5,"The water cycle is a necessary process needed to sustain life on Earth. The first step in the water cycle would be evaporation, evaporation occurs when the sun heats up water, causing it to turn into steam and float into the clouds. The next step is condensation; the process in which the air particles condense into tightly packed molecules, causing clouds to form as they come in contact with hot air. After that step, precipitation happens. Precipitation is when the collection of water stored in the clouds releases onto the Earthen soil through rain, snow or sleet. The last step is collection. Collection occurs when the precipitation is released."
4,"Evaporation is when rain rises into the clouds, to make precipitation. condensation is the conversion of a vopor or gas to a liquid the water collects as droplets on a cold surface when humid air is in contact with it. Collection happens when water is collected. It gets collected in the oceans and rivers, and other bodies of water."
4,"Evaporation is the first part of the water cycle. While the water vapor is collecting in the clouds it condenses and becomes heavier. Therefore, condensation occurs. After the water is to dense for the cloud to hold, precipitation happens. After precipitation,the water collects in bodies of water. The collection stays there until it is evaporated again."
3,"Evaporation is a science concept I do not fully understand! Condensation is the second stage of the water cycle in which gaseous water collects in the sky in the form of clouds. Precipitation is moisture such as rain or mist. Examples of precipitation is rain, sleet, hail, or snow. Water collection is when it rains and water gathers to form puddles and ponds. All these steps repeating is called the water cycle."
0,"Oh my gooooooossshhh its evaporation the gaseous water is going to eat us!! Then all of a sudden condensation man appeared, here to save the day from the killerprecipitation! Maybe collection will be there for us and all these oceans will keep us from being eaten!?!?!? Then Lobster boy appeared Precipitations sidekick, his pinchers a snapping with excitement. Mmmm I like lobster arrrgghhh Ill eat him for dinner!! Dun dun dahhhhhhhh!!!!!! then he stepped in salt water taffy and got stuck to the pavement. He stayed there so long cause the taffy kept stretching that he cooked perfectly red. Yay were saved by dat taffy doe! now we gonna have to cut a bish out to eat her."
4,"A collection of water is called a lake, ocean, sea, or river. Then evaporation occurs, so the water goes into the sky as gas. When the water is the air as a gas it is condensation,or clouds. After that, condensation turns into precipitation as rain, snow,sleet, or hail."
0,"Aliens get ""evaporated"" into the sky when they float into the air. the aliens become the clouds and then it starts to rain so collection happens. All of the alien guts go everywhere when it precipitates after evaporation."
4,"The water cycle is the order in which water travels in a continuous movement from earth to air in back with; evaporation, condensation, precipitation and collection.Evaporation starts the process by turning liquid water, into water vapor. Then, as the clouds build up the mass of the vapors, the cloud gets heavy. Then, the liquid water falls from the cloud as precipitation to earth. As the water reaches earth, it gathers in holes and streets and such in the process of collection. Then the water cycle starts again as more and more water condensates."
5,"The water cycle is the cycle of water that includes, evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection. The water cycle uses these to keep water cycling around the earth, in different states of matter: solid, (ice) liquid, (liquid water) and gas. (water vapor) The evaporation is when water turns in to water vapor (the changing of liquid to a gas. Condensation is when water vapor condenses into clouds. Precipitation is when it rains or liquid falls out of the sky (when water is getting dragged down by gravity from clouds,this concludes rain). Collection is the process of water collecting (after precipitation) in bodies of water."
4,"The water cycle is the cycle of which water moves from earth to the atmosphere, beginning with evaporation. The water turns into water vapor and goes into the atmosphere, after this condensation occurs. After the water condenses into clouds,precipitation begins. The water falls to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail and collection happens, the water collects in rivers, lakes, and oceans."
5,"The first part of the water cycle is evaporation which is the changing of a liquid into a gas, often under the influence of heat (as in the boiling of water). The second part of the water cycle is condensation which is the conversion of a vapor or gas to a liquid; water that collects as droplets on a cold surface when humid air is in contact with it.The third part of the water cycle is precipitation which is any product of the condensation of atmospheric water vapor that falls under gravity. The last part in the water cycle is collection which is when water that falls from the clouds as rain, snow, hail or sleet, collects in the oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams."
4,"It all starts with water. Then the sun heats the water up which makes evaporation. After all the water has evaporated the water forms a cloud which is condensation. When the cloud gets to full of water it lets go in forms of rain,snow,hail,or sleet which are forms of precipitation. Finally the cloud has let go of all the water it goes into an ocean, lakes, rivers ,or streams which is collection."
3,"The first part of the water cycle begins with evaporation. When evaporation happens condensation forms in the clouds. When the clouds are filled with condensation,precipitation or rain starts to fall from the clouds. When the precipitation falls to earth again, it falls into a collection of water like, a ocean, or river. After collection the whole cycle starts over again."
5,"Evaporation is when water turns from a liquid to a gas because of the heat in the air.Condensation is the transformation of a gas into a liquid in the air and forms clouds.Precipitation is the products of condensation using water from the atmosphere the fall from the clouds(gravity) .A example of this is hail,sleet,rain and snow. collection is when precipitation collects in the ocean, streams, or rivers and the cycle starts all over again."
5,"First, the water cycle starts with evaporation, where water turns into vapor after the sun heats it up. Next is condensation, in which the water vapor condenses on the dust in the sky; thus forming clouds. After the water condenses, the cloud will get heavy and drop the water in the forms of snow, rain, sleet, or hail, this part, is precipitation.Collection occurs when the water falls down and collects on the/in the ground."
4,"When the water in my glass was left in the sun, the first step in the water cycle,evaporation made some of the water evaporate. Then the evaporated water turns to clouds. This is condensation. When the clouds get to much condensation then they have precipitation, also called rain. Precipitation doesn't only fall as rain, it also falls as snow, hail, rain and sleet. Collection is when the precipitation fall and it collects as oceans ground water."
3,"The watercycle starts off with the water turning into water vapor. ( evaporation ) After the it evaporates, the clouds collect it. ( collection ) <- FAIL (doesnt do that yet and that isnt right) Then the water vapor rises and joins the clouds and condensates (condensation ). Then the clouds begin to rain ( precipitation ). Then, the precipitation goes into a stream or other body of water and it collects the precipitation ( collection ). THATS ALL FOLKS!"
1,"Evaporation sounds like something I would want to happen to problems, but it is part of the water cycle. condensation is like a sponge absorbing water. The water it must absorb is called precipitation! collection is like water running down a hill and landing in a lake."
